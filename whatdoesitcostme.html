  <p> The price of a defuse kit differs from the casual and the competitive gamemode. </p>
<p> In the casual mode, it costs only $200. Which isn't that much considering you'll get $2100 per round even if you lose the round and didn't make any kills. </p>
<p> However, in the competetive mode it costs twice as much. Coming down at a reasonable $400. </p>
