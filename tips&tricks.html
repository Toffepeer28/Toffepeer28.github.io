  <p> If you have too much money, the defuser is a must buy! </p>
  <p> The bomb can be defused by only one person at a time. So if someone in the team has a defuser and you don't, let him do the job! </p>
  <p> When a teammate dies who had bought a defuser, you can pick it up and use it for yourself! </p>
  <p> When you're in a hurry and the enemy is firing at you while you want to defuse, try to use a smoke grenade or a flashbang on the bomb while you defuse.
    This will make you invisible for a small amount of time. Using this tactic works best when you have bought a defuse kit! </p>
